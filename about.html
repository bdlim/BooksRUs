    <h2>How It Started</h2>
    <p>
      What began as nothing more than a class project, we found ourselves becoming immersed with creating a site to relive the past. Our goal is to rekindle the light that kids once had when reading their favorite stories with their parents. To share with kids a tale back to the past when books were once the best pastimes and experiences.
    </p>
    <h2>A Fun Experience</h2>
    <p>
      The child is in control of the cart. (But only to an extent!) Here at BooksRUs, we want the kids to be the one in deciding what they want. Let their creativity explore their interests and give them the freedom to do what they want.
    </p>
    <h2>Encourage Learning</h2>
    <p>
      We believe that reading is one of the best tools for kids to share laughter and joy to the world. But to do that, we want parents to be there to support their child. Parents will actively engage with their child as they shop around the site. Interactions between parent and children will promote a stronger relationship and healthy buying habits.
